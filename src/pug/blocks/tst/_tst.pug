                                    p.tst-text.ml-1 Thank you so much for everything you did for us at our wedding. You and Annette were an indispensable source of knowledge on the day of, and events leading up to the wedding, in addition to providing us with amazing photos. Photography isn't something we would have prioritized had we been left to our own devices, but now we see what a mistake that would have been. And although we are both very private people, sharing those special moments with the two of you, and trusting your professional judgement, yielded some awesome results.
